# For those who need support

We're classifying the different types of support you may need into 3.
Each section of this document covers how to deal with the individual sections you may require support with.

For any questions about this document or live support, join our Slack [here.](https://rsg-slack.herokuapp.com) We will also cover support from all 3 types on our Slack (for community grievances, we will refer you to our code of conduct).

## Support with development and contributing

You can file an issue on the GitHub issue tracker for support from our community or talk with us at the #development channel of our slack.

## Support with using our service

You can file an issue if you don't mind a small wait, though we personally recommend you come to the #general channel of our Slack for live support.

## Support with any grievances about our community

Please avoid coming to our Slack for this matter and refer to our Code of Conduct.

E-mail rsg.group.here@gmail.com with a CC to ansari.ibrahim1@gmail.com for your greivance after going through our code of conduct.
